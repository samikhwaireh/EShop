# E-Shop API Documentation

Welcome to the E-Shop API documentation! This document provides an overview of the features and technical approaches used in the E-Shop API application.

## Introduction

The E-Shop API application is a powerful and scalable backend system for an e-commerce platform. It provides a comprehensive set of API endpoints to manage products, categories, orders, carts, and user authentication. The application is built using ASP.NET Core, a cross-platform framework for building modern web applications.

## Features

The E-Shop API application includes an extensive range of features to empower your e-commerce platform:

- **Product Management**: Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing products. Create new products, retrieve product details, update existing products, and remove products from the system.
- **Category Management**: Effortlessly manage product categories with support for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting categories. Categorize your products to provide a seamless browsing experience for your customers.
- **Order Management**: Seamlessly handle order processing and management. Create new orders, retrieve order details, update order status, and even cancel orders if needed.
- **Cart Management**: Enable customers to create and manage their shopping carts. Add products to the cart, adjust quantities, and remove items as desired.
- **User Registration and Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts on your platform. Implement secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Generate tokens upon successful login, which can be used to authenticate subsequent requests.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Implement role-based authorization to control access to specific endpoints. Assign roles to users (e.g., Admin, User) and define policies to restrict access based on these roles.
- **Error Handling Middleware**: Provide a robust error handling mechanism to ensure a smooth user experience. Custom middleware is implemented to handle and format API errors, providing consistent and informative error responses.
- **Database Seeding**: Automatically populate your database with initial data using the database seeding feature. Customize the seed data to match your specific requirements.

Feel free to customize and expand this README document based on your project's specific features and requirements.

## Technical Approaches

The E-Shop API application adopts several industry-standard technical approaches to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability:

- **ASP.NET Core**: The application is built using ASP.NET Core, a mature and powerful framework for developing web applications. It offers cross-platform compatibility, high performance, and a rich set of features for building robust APIs.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Entity Framework Core is leveraged as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for seamless interaction with the underlying database. Benefit from its extensive capabilities for managing database operations and performing data migrations.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), a secure and stateless authentication mechanism. Generate tokens upon successful login, and include them in subsequent requests to authenticate and authorize users.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: The application implements role-based authorization, which allows you to control access to specific endpoints based on user roles. Create and assign roles to users, and define policies that restrict access to certain parts of your API.
- **Swagger**: Swagger is integrated into the application to provide interactive API documentation. Access the Swagger UI to explore the available endpoints, review request/response formats, and even test the API directly from the documentation.
- **Error Handling Middleware**: A custom error handling middleware is implemented to gracefully handle and format API errors. This ensures consistent error responses across different endpoints, making it easier for clients to understand and handle errors.
- **Database Seeding**: The application includes a database seeding process to populate the database with initial data. Use this feature to pre-populate the system with categories, products, or any other required data, making it ready for immediate use.

## Getting Started

To get started with the E-Shop API application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the application settings by updating the `appsettings.json` file with your database connection string, JWT secret key, and other required settings.
3. Build and run the application using your preferred method (Visual Studio, command line, etc.).
4. Use a tool like Postman or Swagger to explore and test the API endpoints.

Make sure to install the required dependencies and configure any necessary environment variables before running the application.
